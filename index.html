    <p>
       We take this symbol because if we use a proportional amount of knowledge and technology we can do many amzing thinks 
        but if we have less knoledge that technology could happen very bad thinks. There are many examples in Black mirrow.

  <h2>Opinion about technology</h2>
   
   

   <p>
   <blockquote>I think that technology must have a good knowledge of the limits of technology because technology is for practical 
       uses such as learning or communication, however technology has its limits and are when they are given
An appropriate use of this, without using technology as a means to hurt someone or look for inappropriate things. 
       These limits of technology make this element can be very useful for society as long as its limits are taken into account.
       </p>
       
        <p>
       I think that technology improvement our knowledge tools and skills, because technology makes us have a greater knowledge
       about things because it is a learning tool in which we can investigate or look for more information about things that we 
       do not have clear, besides the technology Its objective is to facilitate the realization or The achievement of something. 
       And so we can improve our knowledge, with technology we can have a greater opportunity to investigate, to know, to learn. 
       So with this element we will have a greater opportunity for knowledge skills because it facilitates learning new things.
